Data Structures can be defined as a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently. Data structures play a very important role in any software development as they help us to store and retrieve data as fast as possible.

Why do we need Data Structures?

    Large amounts of data is processed by different systems and if this is not stored properly, it will lead to data loss.

    It is easier to search for a particular data if it is organized in a proper format.

    Data Structures help a program to minimize the usage of resources such as memory and space.

There are different types of data structures like list, stack, queue, etc. Each of them are suitable for specific type of tasks.

Data structures can also be categorized as linear and non-linear. 

A linear data structure is the one in which elements are arranged in a sequential manner and each element is connected to its previous and next element. 

A non-linear data structure is the one in which elements are not arranged in a sequential manner and each element is connected to other elements through multiple paths.
