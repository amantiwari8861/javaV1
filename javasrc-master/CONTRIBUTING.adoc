= Contributing

First, thanks for wanting to contribute!

You have to be logged in to github.

If your change is trivial (one line fix, typo, etc):

. Click `Issues` at top of page.
. Click green `New Issue` button.
. Describe the fix.

If you change is longer, or requires a test because it changes executable code, please do this:

. Fork the repository (button in the upper right);
. Download your forked copy or, if your change is simple, make it on the web interface. Commit your changes.
. Run the tests. Add a test if the code you're changing doesn't have one yet. Make sure tests pass.
. Click the `Pull Requests` link at the top, and click the green `New Pull Request` button.

If you are prevented from using GitHub for any reason, use https://darwinsys.com/contact.jsp[my contact form].

Submitting a contribution here constitutes acceptance of licensing your code under the existing open source license.
You also warrant that you have the legal right to contribute your change.

Thanks for helping!
