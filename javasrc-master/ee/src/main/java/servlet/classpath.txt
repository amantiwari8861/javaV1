CLASSPATH PROBLEM

You do not appear to have the javax.servlet package in your CLASSPATH.

You will need to download and install this file in order to compile 
the programs in `pwd`. Either get and install TomCat from 
http://java.apache.org, or get another Servlet Engine, or
get the API-only class files from http://java.sun.com/
