<p>This is a demonstration of a very toy PDF Coupon Servlet that Ian
wrote a long time ago. 
Today it would be done with Jasper Reports...
</p>
<h1>Get your free coupon now!</h1>
<p>Please give us your name and we will print up a
customized coupon for you.
In theory this coupon would save you all kinds of money!</p>
<form method="get" action="/servlet/PDFCouponServlet">
<h4>So who are you anyway?</h4>
<input name="name" type="text" size="20">

<input type="submit" value="Get YOURS!">
