# Typical example of jndi.properties
#
# Context.INITIAL_CONTEXT_FACTORY (aka java.naming.factory.initial)
# is always needed for JNDI
java.naming.factory.initial=org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory
# Provider URL is pretty common
java.naming.provider.url=jnp://localhost:1099
java.naming.provider.url=localhost
# Others are optional; JBoss seems to want this one.
java.naming.factory.url.pkgs=org.jboss.naming:org.jnp.interfaces
# user name and password may also be needed...
