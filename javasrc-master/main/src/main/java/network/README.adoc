== Networking Demos

This directory has a pile of useful/interesting stuff, including:

* WebServer0, a very basic web server
* JsseWebServer0, a subclass that just adds SSL/TLS encryption
  (note that you MUST provide the keystore; see runJsseServer.sh!!).
* Several other network protocol clients and servers.

You can read about some of these in the third edtion of the
Java Cookbook (see http://javacook.darwinsys.com/).
