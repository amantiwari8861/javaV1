== Java RegExp Examples

These programs were originally based on the Java Cookbook,
Chapter 4, Regular Expressions.
They have been updated for Java 11.
Some of the early demos were presented as part of my
Javopolis 2002 presentation (November 2002, Antwerp).
As of 2008, Javopolis had been re-named to
http://www.devoxx.com[Devoxx] for some reason.
They've been used in other demos since.
