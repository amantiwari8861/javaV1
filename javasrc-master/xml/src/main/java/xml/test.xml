<P>Numbers are basic to just about any computation.
They're used for array indices, for temperatures, for salaries,
for ratings of various kinds, and a hundred other things.
Yet they're not as simple as they seem.
With floating point numbers, how accurate is accurate?
With random numbers, how random is random?
With strings that should contain a number,
what actually constitutes a number? </P>
<P>Java has several built-in types that can be used to represent numbers,
summarized in this table. Note that unlike languages like C or Perl
which don't specify the size or precision of numeric type, Java--
with its goal of portability--specifies these exactly.</P>
