Walk the tree using recursion, instead of a linear walk.
This should eliminate the problem of:

	MIF: "C:\book\javacook\xml.fm" (2942): Invalid opcode: ParaLine.
	--- Skipping these chars:< String "flyweight" or ultra-light. > >
	---------- Done skipping.
	MIF: "C:\book\javacook\xml.fm" (2945): Invalid opcode: ParaLine.
	--- Skipping these chars:< String That is, we only create one of each
	of > > ---------- Done skipping.

... etc: lines being outputted AFTER the ending > of their Para.

Use Code for examples.
